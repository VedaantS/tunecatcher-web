so that music doesn't have to be hoarded behind a paywall. 

## Why did I create TuneCatcher? 

Because companies like Spotify and Apple Music are unfairly charging consumers hundreds of dollars per annum to listen to music, when there exist  sustainable business models which allow for free music (without interrupting the viewer every five minutes with ads, like Spotify Free). This duopoly, which remains unchallenged in the US, has forced prices up and imposed the unnecessary burden of a 'music subscription' upon any music-loving Americans. 

Think of this as the efforts of one music-loving sixteen-year-old to make the world a better place for music-listeners -- especially those who can't afford fancy subscriptions.

## But aren't there other apps like this? 

Yes, but everything I've come across has a glaring flaw. Some (Nuclear, for example) are ugly, others (like Audius) only have a limited selection of music. I also don't like Audius's whole crypto thing -- I just want to listen to the song, ffs. 

Soundcloud, Spotify and the like care more about their profits than their consumers, and I've listed my reservations with both paywalls and ad-based models above. 

Other apps have been blacklisted from app stores, mostly because they source their music illegally. 

## But I want to support artists! (also read: is this legal?) 

Well, TuneCatcher actually *does* support the artists who you listen to. The content from TuneCatcher is essentially taken from the JioSaavn API, JioSaavn being an Indian music service. Since Jio pays all appropriate dues, your listening is indeed supporting artists (or, more likely, to record companies -- but that's a different story). 

Also, listening to Spotify is definitely not supporting artists either -- Spotify is a ruthlessly exploitative company, and this is no secret in the music world. 

## Why is \*insert feature\* so shitty? 

I'm a sixteen-year-old who develops this late at night after doing schoolwork and the like. I am not employing 3000 people like Spotify is. I can't tend to everything. If you see a problem, file an issue! 

In the next couple days, I'll try to get everything off the ground, and there'll probably be a lot of bug fixes. Let's see where to go from there.
